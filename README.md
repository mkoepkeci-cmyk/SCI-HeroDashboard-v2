## Database Architecture

The application uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with 20+ tables organized into categories:

### Core Data Tables
- Team members and manager hierarchy
- Initiatives with metrics, financial impact, performance data
- Dashboard metrics and highlights
- Field options for dynamic configuration

### User-Generated Tables
- Effort logs (weekly time tracking)
- Governance requests (team consultation intake)

### Configuration Tables
- Application config (branding, labels, primary brand color)
- Field options (10 field types: work types, statuses, roles, phases, groups impacted, impact categories, etc.)
- Capacity thresholds and calculator weights

**All migrations** are managed in `/supabase/migrations/` with timestamped SQL files.

See `/docs/database/SCHEMA_OVERVIEW.md` for complete schema documentation.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Initiatives not showing?**
- Check status filter (Active/Completed tabs)
- Verify team member filter
- Check search term

**Edit form empty?**
- Ensure data fetched with full relations
- Check browser console for Supabase errors

**Effort logs not saving?**
- Verify week is selected (not future)
- Confirm hours/effort size entered
- Check initiative has Active/Planning status

See **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** Troubleshooting section for more details.
