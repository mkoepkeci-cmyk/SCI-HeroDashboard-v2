# Database Security Fixes - Summary

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Migration**: `20251027000003_fix_view_security_definer.sql`

## Issues Fixed

Your Supabase database had three types of security warnings:

### 1. Views with SECURITY DEFINER Property

**Problem**: Views defined with `SECURITY DEFINER` execute with the permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user, which can bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Views Fixed**:
- `initiative_effort_trends`
- `weekly_effort_summary`

**Solution**: Recreated both views with `security_invoker = true` to ensure they respect RLS policies.

### 2. Tables Without Row Level Security (RLS)

**Problem**: Tables exposed to PostgREST API without RLS enabled are accessible to all users regardless of permissions.

**Tables Fixed**:
- `work_type_hours` - Now has RLS enabled with policies
- `capacity_history` - Now has RLS enabled with policies
- `dashboard_metrics` - Now has RLS enabled with policies (if exists)
- `initiative_team_members` - Now has RLS enabled with policies (if exists)

**Solution**: Enabled RLS and created standard CRUD policies for each table:
- Public read access (SELECT) for anon and authenticated users
- Insert, update, delete access for authenticated users only

### 3. Functions with Mutable search_path

**Problem**: Functions without a `SET search_path` clause can be exploited by malicious users who manipulate the schema search path to redirect function calls to malicious objects.

**Functions Fixed**:
- `update_is_active`
- `calculate_capacity_utilization`
- `update_work_type_hours_timestamp`
- `update_dashboard_metrics_timestamp` (if exists)
- `update_effort_logs_updated_at`
- `update_initiative_completion`
- `update_parent_initiative_completion`
- `calculate_initiative_completion`

**Solution**: Added `SET search_path = public` to all functions to prevent search_path manipulation attacks.

## How to Apply This Migration

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **+ New Query**
4. Copy and paste the contents of [20251027000003_fix_view_security_definer.sql](./supabase/migrations/20251027000003_fix_view_security_definer.sql)
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd c:\Users\marty\SCI-HeroDashboard-v2-main

# Run the migration
supabase db push
```

## What Changed

### 1. Views Recreated with SECURITY INVOKER
- **weekly_effort_summary**: Now uses `WITH (security_invoker = true)`
- **initiative_effort_trends**: Now uses `WITH (security_invoker = true)`

Both views maintain the exact same functionality, but now properly respect user permissions.

### 2. Tables with New RLS Policies

Each table now has these policies:

1. **Allow public read access** - Anyone can SELECT
2. **Allow authenticated insert** - Logged-in users can INSERT
3. **Allow authenticated update** - Logged-in users can UPDATE
4. **Allow authenticated delete** - Logged-in users can DELETE

This matches the security model used throughout the rest of your schema.

### 3. Functions Updated with search_path Security

All 8 functions have been recreated with `SET search_path = public` clause:

- **Trigger functions**: `update_is_active`, `calculate_capacity_utilization`, `update_work_type_hours_timestamp`, `update_dashboard_metrics_timestamp`, `update_effort_logs_updated_at`, `update_initiative_completion`, `update_parent_initiative_completion`
- **Utility functions**: `calculate_initiative_completion`

All functions maintain their exact same behavior - only the security model has been hardened.

## Testing After Migration

After running the migration, test the following:

1. **Views still work**: Query `initiative_effort_trends` and `weekly_effort_summary` to ensure they return data
2. **Tables accessible**: Query `work_type_hours` and `capacity_history` to ensure data is still accessible
3. **App still functions**: Run your dashboard and check that all views load properly

## Expected Outcome

After running this migration:
- ✅ All Supabase security warnings should be resolved
- ✅ 2 views secured with SECURITY INVOKER
- ✅ 4 tables protected with Row Level Security
- ✅ 8 functions hardened against search_path attacks
- ✅ Your database will be more secure with proper RLS enforcement
- ✅ No functionality changes - everything works the same way
- ✅ Better protection against unauthorized data access

**Security Issues Resolved**: ~15 critical security warnings from Supabase

## Important Notes

### Migration is Idempotent
This migration is **safe to run multiple times**:
- Uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before creating policies
- Uses `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS CASCADE` before recreating views
- Wraps `ALTER TABLE ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` in error handling
- Checks for table/function existence before operating

### If You Get Errors
If you see errors about existing policies or objects, **the migration is already partially applied**. You can:
1. Run it again (it will skip what's already done)
2. Or ignore the errors if all security warnings are already resolved

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this migration (not recommended):

```sql
-- Recreate views without security_invoker
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS weekly_effort_summary CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW weekly_effort_summary AS
SELECT ... -- (original view definition)

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS initiative_effort_trends CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW initiative_effort_trends AS
SELECT ... -- (original view definition)

-- Disable RLS on tables
ALTER TABLE work_type_hours DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE capacity_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- etc.
```

## Notes

- This migration is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times
- Uses `IF EXISTS` checks to avoid errors on missing objects
- Policies use the same permission model as your existing tables
- No data is modified, only security settings are changed
