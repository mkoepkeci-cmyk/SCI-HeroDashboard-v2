# System Clinical Informatics Dashboard

A React-based dashboard application for tracking and visualizing the impact of CommonSpirit Health's System Clinical Informatics team initiatives, assignments, and performance metrics.

## Data Architecture

**All data comes from Supabase tables, synced from Google Sheets:**

```
Google Sheets (Source of Truth)
    ‚Üì (Auto-sync)
Supabase Tables
    ‚Üì (API)
React Dashboard App
```

### Data Sources

1. **Google Sheets ‚Üí Supabase** (Auto-synced):
   - `team_members` - Team member information
   - `assignments` - Individual work assignments
   - `initiatives` - Initiative details and metadata
   - `dashboard_metrics` - Pre-calculated workload metrics
   - All other initiative-related tables

2. **User-Generated Data** (Created in app):
   - `effort_logs` - Weekly time tracking (NOT in Google Sheets)

**IMPORTANT**: The dashboard reads from Supabase tables, NOT from CSV/Excel files. Any CSV references in docs are legacy and should be ignored.

## üöÄ DATA POPULATION INSTRUCTIONS

### Current Status

**Marty's data has been completed as a pilot:**
- 7 total initiatives populated (3 completed, 4 active)
- Initiatives categorized by work type
- All new fields (Role, EHRs Impacted, Service Line) implemented
- Process documented and tested

### Remaining SCI Team Members

**CSV files in `documents/` folder for 15 additional team members:**
- Ashley, Brooke, Dawn, Jason, Josh, Kim, Lisa, Marisa, Matt, Melissa, Robin, Sherry, Trudy, Van, Yvette

### Data Population Strategy

**DO NOT duplicate work_type_summary counts!**

The current system has two data types:
1. **work_type_summary** - Aggregate counts (e.g., "Josh has 47 assignments")
2. **initiatives** - Detailed project tracking with metrics, financials, stories

**Key Principle:** When adding initiatives, DO NOT increase the total_assignments count. Initiatives are a "drill-down" into existing assignments.

### Step-by-Step Process for Each SCI

#### 1. Review CSV File
For each team member (e.g., Josh):
- Read `documents/SCI Assignments Tracker - [Name].csv`
- Identify 3-7 highest-impact assignments that should become detailed initiatives

#### 2. Selection Criteria for Initiatives

**Create initiatives for:**
- ‚úÖ Projects with defined go-live dates
- ‚úÖ System-wide initiatives (multi-market impact)
- ‚úÖ Work with measurable outcomes (revenue, time savings, users)
- ‚úÖ Assignments with clinical sponsor/governance oversight
- ‚úÖ Significant work effort (M, L, XL size)
- ‚úÖ Completed work worth showcasing

**DO NOT create initiatives for:**
- ‚ùå Routine governance meeting attendance
- ‚ùå Epic Gold CAT facilitation (unless major deliverable)
- ‚ùå Standard support/consulting work
- ‚ùå Minor optimization requests
- ‚ùå Weekly/monthly recurring meetings

#### 3. Data Mapping from CSV to Form

| CSV Column | Form Field | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| SCI | Team Member | Select from dropdown |
| SCI | Owner | Same as team member name |
| Assignment | Initiative Name | Clean up formatting |
| Work Type | Type | Direct map |
| Status | Status | Direct map |
| Role | Role | Primary/Co-Owner/Secondary/Support |
| EHR/s Impacted | EHRs Impacted | All/Epic/Cerner/Altera |
| Service Line | Service Line | Ambulatory, Pharmacy, etc. |
| Projected Go-Live Date | End Date | If available |
| Assignment Date | Start Date | If available |
| Sponsor | Clinical Sponsor Name | Parse name |
| Short Description | Story - Challenge | Use for context |
| Comments/Details | Story - Approach/Outcome | Rich context here |

#### 4. Fields That Require Additional Research

These fields are NOT in CSV - leave blank or research:
- Clinical Sponsor Title
- Governance Bodies (may be in comments)
- Key Collaborators (may be in description)
- Financial Impact (all fields)
- Metrics (baseline/current/target values)
- Performance Data (users deployed, adoption rate)
- Projections (scaling scenarios)

#### 5. Example Workflow for Josh

Josh has 47 total assignments. Recommended 5-7 initiatives:

**High Priority (Create These):**
1. C5 Titrations of Medications Workgroup (System Initiative, go-live 6/3/25)
2. Alaris Pumps Standardization Project (Project, weekly meetings)
3. Standardizing Medication Charging (Epic Gold, XL effort, system-wide)
4. Heparin Drip Calculator Standardization (Epic Gold, design phase)
5. Epic Upgrade Nova Note Review - Willow Inpatient (Epic Upgrades, completed)

**Keep as work_type_summary (Don't Create):**
- All 8 SCrPT governance meetings
- Epic Gold CAT participation
- Regional support meetings

**Result:** Josh still shows 47 total assignments, but now has 5-7 detailed initiatives

#### 6. Creating Initiatives

**Option A: Use the UI** (Recommended for refinement)
1. Go to http://localhost:5175
2. Click "Add Data"
3. Fill out form for each initiative
4. Use only data from CSV (don't invent)
5. Leave unknown fields blank

**Option B: Create Scripts** (Recommended for bulk)
1. Use `populate-marty-initiatives.ts` as template
2. Create similar script for each team member
3. Map CSV data to initiative fields
4. Run script: `npx tsx populate-[name]-initiatives.ts`

### Team Member Priority Order

**Start with team members who have:**
1. Highest assignment counts (more visible impact)
2. Clear project work (easier to identify initiatives)
3. Completed work to showcase

**Suggested Order:**
1. ‚úÖ Marty (COMPLETED - 19 assignments ‚Üí 7 initiatives)
2. Josh (47 assignments - pharmacy/Epic Gold focus)
3. Van (31 assignments)
4. Dawn (30 assignments)
5. Lisa (27 assignments)
6. Trudy (25 assignments)
7. Sherry (23 assignments)
8. Continue with remaining team members...

### Quality Over Quantity

**Better to have:**
- 50-100 well-documented initiatives
- Complete information from CSV
- Clear impact stories

**Than:**
- 500 half-empty initiative records
- Missing critical data
- Duplicated work_type_summary counts

### Example Scripts Directory

Reference these for guidance:
- `populate-marty-initiatives.ts` - Marty's active initiatives
- `add-completed-initiatives.ts` - Marty's completed initiatives

### Data Integrity Checks

After populating each team member:

**Verify:**
1. ‚úÖ total_assignments count UNCHANGED
2. ‚úÖ work_type_summary counts UNCHANGED
3. ‚úÖ 3-7 new initiatives created
4. ‚úÖ Initiatives show in Team view, categorized by work type
5. ‚úÖ All data comes from CSV (no invented information)

## Notes

- The application is designed for internal use by CommonSpirit Health's System Clinical Informatics team
- All financial and operational data is retrieved from Supabase in real-time
- The dashboard supports both aggregate and individual team member views
- **CRITICAL**: Do not duplicate work_type_summary counts when adding initiatives - initiatives are drill-downs, not new assignments
- Supabase credentials are stored in `.env` file (not committed to repository)
- CSV source files in `documents/` folder contain raw assignment data for all team members
- Use Marty's completed work as reference model for quality and approach
