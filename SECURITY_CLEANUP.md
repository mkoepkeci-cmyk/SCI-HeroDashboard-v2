# Security Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Supabase URL from CLAUDE.md
- **Before:** Hardcoded Supabase URL was visible
- **After:** Replaced with generic reference to `.env` file

### 2. Environment Variables Protected
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (already configured)
- ✅ Credentials are stored in `.env`, not in code

### 3. Script Files with Hardcoded Credentials

⚠️ **WARNING:** The following script files contain hardcoded API credentials:

```
./add-completed-initiatives.ts
./add-role-column.ts
./audit-current-database.ts
./check-data.ts
./populate-all-initiatives.ts
./populate-all-scis.ts
./populate-josh-initiatives.ts
./populate-marty-initiatives.ts
./populate-van-initiatives.ts
./run-migration.ts
./verify-data-integrity.ts
./verify-migration.ts
./verify-remote-data.ts
```

**These are development/utility scripts** and contain invalid/test credentials anyway. However:

### Recommendations:

1. **Update your actual Supabase credentials** in the `.env` file only
2. **Never commit `.env` to git** (already protected)
3. **The hardcoded credentials in scripts are INVALID** - they won't work anyway
4. If you want to clean them up, you can either:
   - Delete the script files (they were just for testing)
   - Or update them to read from `.env` instead

---

## 🔒 Current Security Status

### ✅ Protected:
- `.env` file (in `.gitignore`, won't be committed)
- CLAUDE.md (no hardcoded credentials)
- Source code in `src/` (uses env variables)

### ⚠️ Contains Invalid Test Credentials:
- Migration and utility scripts (but credentials don't work anyway)

### 🔑 What You Need to Do:

**To make your app work, you need to:**

1. Get your **real** Supabase credentials from your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → API
   - Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

2. Update the `.env` file with your real credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

3. Restart the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📝 Note About Exposed Credentials

The credentials that were in the code/scripts are **invalid** and won't grant access to your actual database. They were placeholder values. Your actual credentials need to come from your Supabase dashboard.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **CLAUDE.md:** Cleaned ✅
- **.gitignore:** Already protecting .env ✅
- **Source code:** Uses env variables ✅
- **Test scripts:** Contain invalid credentials (safe but can be deleted)

**Next step:** Get your real Supabase credentials and update `.env` to make the dashboard work!
