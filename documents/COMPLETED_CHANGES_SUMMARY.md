## Required Actions

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations ⚠️ REQUIRED

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Add all three new columns
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role TEXT;
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ehrs_impacted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS service_line TEXT;

-- Verify columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'initiatives'
AND column_name IN ('role', 'ehrs_impacted', 'service_line')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

### Step 2: Add Completed Initiatives

After running the SQL migration, run:

```bash
npx tsx add-completed-initiatives.ts
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Update Existing Initiatives with New Field Data

```sql
-- Update Abridge
UPDATE initiatives
SET ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory',
    role = 'Primary'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Abridge AI Pilot - Clinical Documentation Efficiency Analysis';

-- Update Notable
UPDATE initiatives
SET ehrs_impacted = 'Cerner',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory',
    role = 'Primary'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Notable Health - RPM to API Migration';

-- Update SDOH
UPDATE initiatives
SET ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory',
    role = 'Support'
WHERE initiative_name LIKE 'Social Determinants of Health%';

-- Update CI Website
UPDATE initiatives
SET ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Other',
    role = 'Support'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Clinical Informatics Enterprise Website';

-- Update HRS Epic
UPDATE initiatives
SET ehrs_impacted = 'Epic',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory',
    role = 'Primary'
WHERE initiative_name = 'HRS Integration - Remote Patient Monitoring'
AND status = 'Active';
```

### Step 4: Test the Changes

1. Refresh the app at http://localhost:5175
2. Navigate to **Team** tab
3. Click on **Marty**
4. Verify:
   - Initiatives are grouped by category (Project, System Initiative, General Support)
   - Completed initiatives show at the top with checkmarks
   - Total shows 7 initiatives
5. Go to **Add Data** tab
6. Verify new fields appear:
   - Role (after Team Member)
   - EHRs Impacted (after Status)
   - Service Line (after EHRs Impacted)

## Data Integrity

3. **Service Line** - Understand which clinical areas benefit from the work
4. **Categorized Display** - Easy to see distribution of work types
5. **Completed Work** - Showcase historical accomplishments
6. **Better Analytics** - More data points for reporting and filtering

---

## Next Steps

After completing the above actions:

1. ✅ Verify Marty's data looks correct
2. 📋 Use this as a template for other team members
3. 🔄 Consider bulk import scripts for remaining team members
4. 📊 Add filters to Initiatives view based on new fields
5. 📈 Create reports/dashboards using EHR and Service Line data

---

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems:

1. Check that all SQL migrations ran successfully
2. Verify the app recompiled without errors (check the terminal)
3. Clear browser cache and refresh
4. Check browser console for any errors

All code changes have been made and tested for TypeScript compatibility.
