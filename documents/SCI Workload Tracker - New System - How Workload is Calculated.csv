CALCULATION EXAMPLES,,,,
Example 1: High-Intensity Assignment,,,,
,,,,
"Owner, System Initiative, Design Phase, Active, Medium Size",,,,
,,,,
Base Hours (M): 3.5 hrs,,,,
Role (Owner): Ã— 1.0,,,,
Type (System Initiative): Ã— 1.0,,,,
Phase (Design): Ã— 0.7,,,,
Active: Ã— 1,,,,
,,,,
[equals] 3.5 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 0.7 Ã— 1 = 2.45 hrs/week,,,,
,,,,
Example 2: Low-Intensity Assignment,,,,
,,,,
"Support, General Support, Did we Deliver, Active, Small Size",,,,
,,,,
Base Hours (S): 1.5 hrs,,,,
Role (Support): Ã— 0.25,,,,
Type (General Support): Ã— 0.5,,,,
Phase (Did we Deliver): Ã— 0.3,,,,
Active: Ã— 1,,,,
,,,,
[equals] 1.5 Ã— 0.25 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 0.3 Ã— 1 = 0.05625 hrs/week,,,,
,,,,
Example 3: Secondary Role Assignment,,,,
,,,,
"Secondary, Policy/Guidelines, Discovery, Active, Large Size",,,,
,,,,
Base Hours (L): 7.5 hrs,,,,
Role (Secondary): Ã— 0.5,,,,
Type (Policy/Guidelines): Ã— 0.7,,,,
Phase (Discovery): Ã— 0.5,,,,
Active: Ã— 1,,,,
,,,,
[equals] 7.5 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 0.7 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 1 = 1.3125 hrs/week,,,,
,,,,
Example 4: Inactive Assignment,,,,
,,,,
"Owner, System Initiative, Build/Test, Inactive, XL Size",,,,
,,,,
Base Hours (XL): 12 hrs,,,,
Role (Owner): Ã— 1.0,,,,
Type (System Initiative): Ã— 1.0,,,,
Phase (Build/Test): Ã— 1.0,,,,
Active: Ã— 0,,,,
,,,,
[equals] 12 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 0 = 0 hrs/week,,,,
,,,,
HOW TOTAL WORKLOAD IS CALCULATED,,,,
Each assignment gets its own weekly hours calculation using the formula above,,,,
Staff member's total workload = Sum of all their active assignment hours,,,,
Capacity utilization = (Total Active Hours / Available Hours) Ã— 100%,,,,
Status indicators:,,,,
ðŸŸ¢ Under Capacity: <60%,,,,
ðŸŸ¡ Near Capacity: 60-75%,,,,
ðŸŸ  At Capacity: 76-84%,,,,
ðŸ”´ Over Capacity: â‰¥85%,,,,
,,,,
KEY INSIGHTS,,,,
Role weight reflects level of responsibility (Owner > Secondary > Support),,,,
Assignment type weight reflects complexity/intensity of work,,,,
Phase weight reflects current workload intensity in project lifecycle,,,,
Active status turns assignments on/off without deleting historical data,,,,
"Assignments marked ""Complete"" automatically have zero active hours",,,,
