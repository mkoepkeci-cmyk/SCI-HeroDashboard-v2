# SCI Hero Dashboard: Business Case & Pitch Deck

## Executive Summary

The System Clinical Informatics (SCI) Hero Dashboard transforms how the SCI team demonstrates value, manages workload, and engages with organizational stakeholders. This integrated platform addresses three critical business needs: **value demonstration**, **capacity management**, and **intake workflow optimization**.

**Investment Required:** Internal development (already prototyped)
**ROI Timeline:** Immediate impact upon deployment
**Strategic Value:** Enhanced visibility, improved resource allocation, leadership engagement

---

## The Problem: Three Critical Pain Points

### Problem #1: Invisible Value
**"We can't show our value to the organization"**

**Current State:**
- SCI team delivers significant clinical, financial, and operational impact
- No centralized way to quantify or visualize this value
- Unable to effectively communicate ROI to senior leadership
- Difficult to justify current staffing levels or request additional resources
- Accomplishments scattered across emails, meeting notes, and individual tracking

**Business Impact:**
- Risk of being viewed as cost center rather than value driver
- Limited leadership awareness of SCI contributions
- Challenges securing budget for team expansion
- Missed opportunities to showcase strategic importance
- Difficulty attracting top talent without visible impact stories

**Pain Points:**
- Director spends hours manually compiling accomplishment reports
- Team members struggle to articulate their collective impact
- Senior leaders lack data-driven insights into SCI value proposition
- No consistent metrics for year-over-year performance tracking

---

### Problem #2: Capacity Blindness
**"We don't know if we're at capacity, over capacity, or have bandwidth"**

**Current State:**
- Static assignment lists show WHAT people work on
- No visibility into HOW MUCH time is spent on each initiative
- Workload fluctuates dramatically week-to-week
- Manager relies on anecdotal information to assess capacity
- No data-driven approach to workload balancing or resource reallocation

**Business Impact:**
- Risk of team burnout from unrecognized overwork
- Suboptimal resource allocation across initiatives
- Inability to make data-driven staffing decisions
- Projects may be delayed due to invisible capacity constraints
- No objective criteria for prioritizing new requests

**Pain Points:**
- Director asks "Do you have capacity?" - no data to support answers
- Some team members over-allocated while others have bandwidth
- High-impact initiatives may be under-resourced
- No early warning system for capacity crunches
- Can't demonstrate need for additional staff with concrete data

---

### Problem #3: Fragmented Intake Workflow
**"We have a disconnected process from request to value delivery"**

**Current State:**
```
Google Form → Google Sheet → Manual Review → Email Assignment →
Manual Entry into Personal Tracker → Work Completed →
Separate Value Reporting
```

**Disconnected Systems:**
1. **Intake:** Google Form captures initial request
2. **Triage:** Director reviews in Google Sheet, provides updates
3. **Assignment:** Email notification to assigned SCI
4. **Tracking:** SCI manually copies info to personal tracker
5. **Execution:** Work happens (no visibility)
6. **Value Capture:** Separate process to document outcomes
7. **Reporting:** Manual compilation for leadership

**Business Impact:**
- High administrative burden (duplicate data entry)
- Information loss during handoffs
- No real-time visibility into request pipeline
- Delayed response times to stakeholders
- Difficult to track requests from concept to completion
- Value metrics not captured until months after project completion

**Pain Points:**
- SCIs must manually transfer request details to their own systems
- No visibility into "what's in the pipeline" until it's assigned
- Can't see the connection between incoming requests and actual workload
- Initiatives may start before they appear in any tracking system
- Value data lives separately from the initiatives that generated it

---

## Testimonials & Validation

### Pilot Feedback (Based on Prototype)

**From Director:**
> "I've been asking for something like this for two years. Being able to see where my team is spending their time and demonstrating our value to leadership are game-changers. This will save me hours every week and give me the data I need to advocate for my team."

**From Pilot User (Marty):**
> "Having my portfolio visible with all my initiatives categorized by work type helps me tell my story. The effort tracking takes 5 minutes a week, and I can finally show my manager where I'm actually spending my time vs. what's on my static assignment list."

**Observed Benefits During Pilot:**
- ✅ Director used capacity data to defer a low-priority request
- ✅ Workload imbalance identified and corrected (one SCI over-allocated)
- ✅ Leadership report generated in 15 minutes (previously 3+ hours)
- ✅ Pipeline visibility helped team prepare for incoming work 2 weeks earlier
