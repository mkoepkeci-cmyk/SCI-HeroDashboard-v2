# Data Quality Analysis - Key Findings

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Analysis Source:** Individual SCI sheets from Excel Workload Tracker

---

## üìä Executive Summary

**Overall Data Quality: 86.8%**
- **363 of 418 assignments** have work effort defined (13.2% missing)
- **Total active hours**: 271.5h/week (based on complete data)
- **Excel Dashboard shows**: 217.9h/week (only counting assignments with effort data)

### Why The Discrepancy?

The Excel Dashboard is **conservative** - it only counts hours for assignments that HAVE work effort estimates. Our analysis shows what the total WOULD BE if all assignments had estimates.

**Example - Josh:**
- Dashboard: 44.5h/week (counting only 73 of 95 assignments that have effort data)
- Full estimate: 51.0h/week (if all 95 assignments had effort data)
- Missing: 22 assignments without work effort

## üö® Priority Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Marisa's Data** - Get all 17 assignments sized (0% complete ‚Üí 100% target)
   - Status shows all as inactive - verify if these are still relevant
   - If active, need work effort estimates immediately

2. **Josh's Missing 22** - Prioritize Josh's 22 missing assignments
   - He's already over capacity at 44.5h/week
   - Missing 22 could add another 6-10 hours if they're active
   - Need accurate picture to prevent burnout

3. **Matt's 7 Missing** - Complete Matt's data (69.6% ‚Üí 100%)
   - Relatively small number to fix
   - Quick win for data quality

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **Brooke's 5 Missing** - Complete Brooke's data (64.3% ‚Üí 100%)
5. **Dawn's 2 Missing** - Complete Dawn's data (90.9% ‚Üí 100%)
6. **Van & Sherry** - Each has 1 missing - quick fixes

## üí° Insights & Patterns

### 1. The "Marisa Mystery"
- 17 assignments, 0 active, 0 hours
- All assignments appear to be inactive/complete
- **Action**: Verify with Marisa if these should be archived or if status is wrong

### 2. Josh's Overload is Understated
- Dashboard shows 44.5h/week (111% capacity)
- But that's only 73 of 95 assignments
- If remaining 22 are active and unsized, true load could be **55-60h/week**
- **Action**: Urgent - size those 22 assignments to understand true capacity

### 3. Excellent Data Stewards
- **Ashley, Jason, Kim, Lisa, Marty, Melissa, Robin, Trudy, Yvette** all have 100% complete data
- These team members are disciplined about tracking work effort
- **Best Practice**: Use their process as template for others

### 4. Work Type Concentration Risks
**Epic Gold:** Heavily concentrated (Josh 38, Marty 16, Van 15)
- If Josh unavailable, Epic Gold work has limited backup
- **Action**: Cross-train Matt (has capacity) or Van on Epic Gold

**Governance:** Concentrated in Josh (20) and Marty (11)
- **Action**: Distribute governance participation more evenly

**System Initiatives:** Better distributed (Jason 15, Trudy 12, Dawn 10)
- This is healthy - no single point of failure

## üìä Visualization Needs for Dashboard

Based on this analysis, your Workload tab should show:

### 1. Data Quality Indicator Per Person
```

```

### 3. Missing Data Alert
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Alert:
- Marisa: 17 missing (CRITICAL)
- Josh: 22 missing (HIGH)
- Matt: 7 missing (MEDIUM)
- Brooke: 5 missing (MEDIUM)
```

### 4. Accurate vs. Estimated Hours
```
Team Member   Known Hours   Estimated Full   Delta
Josh          44.5h         51.0h            +6.5h
Marty         39.1h         30.0h            COMPLETE
Brooke        25.3h         12.5h            COMPLETE BUT MISMATCH?
```

**Note**: Some discrepancies between Dashboard and individual sheets suggest calculation differences - needs investigation.

## üîß Technical Notes

### Data Sources
- **Excel Dashboard Tab**: Pre-calculated by Excel formulas, conservative (only counts complete data)
- **Individual Sheets**: Raw assignment data with work effort in column E
- **Our Analysis**: Reads individual sheets directly, applies same hour estimates

### Work Effort Hour Mapping
```
XS (< 1hr/wk)      = 0.5 hours
S (1-2 hrs/wk)     = 1.5 hours
M (2-5 hrs/wk)     = 3.5 hours
L (5-10 hrs/wk)    = 7.5 hours
XL (> 10 hrs/wk)   = 15.0 hours
```

### Active Status Detection
Assignments counted as "active" if status contains:
- "In Progress"
- "Planning"
- Other statuses (Complete, On Hold) not counted in active hours

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

### For Dashboard Display
1. **Show BOTH numbers**: Known hours (from Dashboard) and Estimated full hours (if complete)
2. **Color-code data quality**: Green (>90%), Yellow (70-90%), Red (<70%)
3. **Make missing data actionable**: Click to see which specific assignments need effort data
4. **Work type breakdown**: Show hours per type, not just counts

### For Data Entry
1. **Create template/guide** for sizing assignments
2. **Regular data quality reviews** (monthly) - chase missing effort estimates
3. **Default to "M" if unknown** - better than blank
4. **Link to dashboard** from Excel - make it easy to see impact

### For Capacity Planning
1. **Use Dashboard hours** for current capacity decisions (conservative, accurate)
2. **Use estimated hours** for "what-if" scenarios and planning
3. **Flag high-missing-data members** (Josh, Marisa) as "capacity uncertain"
4. **Don't assign new work** to people with >20% missing data until cleaned up
