# Unified Form Migration - Current Status

**Branch:** `feature/unified-request-initiative-form`
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Database Migration

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Database Migration Script Created
**File:** [supabase/migrations/20251029000000_unified_form_support.sql](supabase/migrations/20251029000000_unified_form_support.sql)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Adds 4 new columns to `initiatives` table:
  - `problem_statement` TEXT - System-level problem from intake
  - `desired_outcomes` TEXT - Expected outcomes from intake
  - `request_id` TEXT - Governance request ID (GOV-YYYY-XXX) for display
  - `governance_metadata` JSONB - Stores all governance-specific data

- ‚úÖ Adds "Ready for Prioritization" status to `governance_requests` workflow
- ‚úÖ Removes XXL from `effort_logs` constraint (only XS, S, M, L, XL allowed)
- ‚úÖ Populates new fields from existing linked governance requests
- ‚úÖ Includes trigger disable/enable to prevent completion tracking errors
- ‚úÖ Includes rollback instructions

**Status:** Ready to apply ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT YET APPLIED TO DATABASE**

### 2. Code Changes

#### GovernanceRequestDetail.tsx
- ‚úÖ Removed XXL option from work effort dropdown (line 505)
- Only XS, S, M, L, XL now available

#### BulkEffortEntry.tsx
- ‚úÖ Changed line 984-986 to display `request_id` instead of `service_line`
- Governance ticket IDs (GOV-YYYY-XXX) now show under initiative name
- Added `font-mono` class for better ID readability

#### supabase.ts (TypeScript Interfaces)
- ‚úÖ Added new fields to `Initiative` interface:
  - `request_id?: string`
  - `problem_statement?: string`
  - `desired_outcomes?: string`
  - `governance_metadata?: Record<string, any>`

### 3. Git Commits
- ‚úÖ Commit 1: `feat: Add unified form support - Phase 1`
- ‚úÖ Commit 2: `fix: Disable triggers during migration data population`
- ‚úÖ Commit 3: `fix: Remove trigger disable approach, preserve updated_at`

**Note:** Final approach does NOT disable triggers. Instead, it preserves the original `updated_at` timestamp so the completion tracking trigger doesn't think the initiative was just edited.

## üîß Next Step: Apply Database Migration

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The migration script has been created but NOT applied to your Supabase database yet.

### How to Apply:

**Option 1: Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/akruwlxtygedbntrqumx
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Copy entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251029000000_unified_form_support.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify success (should see "Success. No rows returned")

**Option 2: Supabase CLI (if configured)**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\marty\SCI-HeroDashboard-v2-main"
npx supabase db push
```

### Verification After Migration

Run these queries in SQL Editor to confirm:

```sql
-- 1. Verify new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'initiatives'
  AND column_name IN ('problem_statement', 'desired_outcomes', 'governance_metadata', 'request_id');

-- Expected: 4 rows returned

-- 2. Verify populated data from governance requests
SELECT
  i.initiative_name,
  i.request_id,
  i.problem_statement IS NOT NULL as has_problem_statement,
  i.desired_outcomes IS NOT NULL as has_desired_outcomes,
  i.governance_metadata != '{}'::jsonb as has_metadata
FROM initiatives i
WHERE i.governance_request_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Expected: Linked initiatives should have data populated

-- 3. Verify new governance status exists
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM governance_requests ORDER BY status;

-- Expected: Should include "Ready for Prioritization"

-- 4. Verify XXL is blocked
INSERT INTO effort_logs (initiative_id, team_member_id, week_start_date, hours_spent, effort_size)
VALUES ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '2025-01-01', 0, 'XXL');

-- Expected: Should FAIL with constraint violation (this is good!)
```

---

## üìã Remaining Work (After Migration Applied)

### Phase 2: Create Unified Form (8-10 hours)
- Create `UnifiedWorkItemForm.tsx` with 4 tabs:
  - **Tab 1:** Request Details (from GovernanceRequestForm)
  - **Tab 2:** Work Scope & Assignments (from InitiativeSubmissionForm)
  - **Tab 3:** Proposed Solution & EHR Impact (new)
  - **Tab 4:** Outcomes & Results (metrics, financial, performance, projections, story)

### Phase 3: Update Integration Points (2-3 hours)
- Update BulkEffortEntry edit button to open UnifiedWorkItemForm
- Make SCIRequestsCard clickable (opens GovernanceRequestDetail modal)
- Add "Edit Request" button in modal to open UnifiedWorkItemForm
- Update Phase 2 population function to fill new fields

### Phase 4: Testing (2-3 hours)
- Test complete request ‚Üí initiative lifecycle
- Verify capacity calculations unchanged
- Test edit flow from My Effort table
- Test manager views
- Validate data preservation

### Phase 5: Documentation (1 hour)
- Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow
- Update README.md if needed
- Create migration notes

**Total Remaining:** ~13-17 hours

## üîÑ Rollback Instructions

If you need to undo everything and return to the original state:

### 1. Rollback Git Changes
```bash
cd "c:\Users\marty\SCI-HeroDashboard-v2-main"
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/unified-request-initiative-form
```

### 2. Rollback Database Changes (if migration was applied)
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Remove new columns
ALTER TABLE initiatives DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS problem_statement;
ALTER TABLE initiatives DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS desired_outcomes;
ALTER TABLE initiatives DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS governance_metadata;
ALTER TABLE initiatives DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS request_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_initiatives_request_id;

-- Restore old governance status constraint
ALTER TABLE governance_requests DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS valid_status;
ALTER TABLE governance_requests ADD CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN (
  'Draft', 'Ready for Review', 'Needs Refinement', 'Ready for Governance', 'Dismissed'
));

-- Restore XXL to effort logs
ALTER TABLE effort_logs DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS effort_logs_effort_size_check;
ALTER TABLE effort_logs ADD CONSTRAINT effort_logs_effort_size_check
CHECK (effort_size IN ('XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'));
```

## üìä Impact Assessment

### What's Changed (So Far):
- **Database:** 4 new nullable columns (backward compatible)
- **Code:** Minor display changes (service_line ‚Üí request_id)
- **UI:** XXL option removed from one dropdown

### What's NOT Changed:
- ‚úÖ No data loss
- ‚úÖ Capacity calculation unchanged
- ‚úÖ Effort tracking unchanged
- ‚úÖ All existing forms still work
- ‚úÖ Manager views unchanged
- ‚úÖ Dashboard metrics unchanged

### Risk Level: **LOW**
- All changes are additive (new columns are nullable)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Easy rollback available
- Feature branch isolated from main

## üéØ Decision Points

Before proceeding with Phase 2 (UnifiedWorkItemForm), please decide:

1. **Apply migration now or wait?**
   - Recommend: Apply now and verify
   - Can test current changes work correctly
   - UnifiedWorkItemForm will need these fields

2. **Review Phase 1 changes?**
   - Test that request_id displays correctly in My Effort table
   - Verify XXL is gone from dropdown
   - Check that TypeScript doesn't complain

3. **Ready for large form component?**
   - UnifiedWorkItemForm will be 600-800 lines
   - Will take 2-3 hours to create
   - Should test migration first

---

**Recommendation:** Apply the migration now, test the display changes, then proceed with UnifiedWorkItemForm creation in next session.
