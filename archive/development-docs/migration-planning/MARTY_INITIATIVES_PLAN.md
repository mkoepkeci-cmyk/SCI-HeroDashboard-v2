## Database Impact

**Before:**
- Total Assignments: 19
- Work Type Summary:
  - General Support: 6
  - System Initiative: 2
  - Epic Gold: 7
  - Governance: varies
  - Project: 4
- Initiatives: 1 (Abridge)

**After (Recommended Phase 1-2):**
- Total Assignments: 19 (UNCHANGED)
- Work Type Summary: UNCHANGED
- Initiatives: 6 total
  - 1 existing (Abridge)
  - 3 new active projects
  - 2 completed projects

**Result:** Marty's portfolio now shows 6 major initiatives out of 19 total assignments, with the remaining 13 being routine governance, support, and CAT facilitation work.

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm scope** with Marty - which initiatives to create?
2. **Gather additional data** for each initiative:
   - Actual metrics/measurements
   - Financial impact (if any)
   - Success stories/outcomes
3. **Populate via form** - Use the Initiative Submission Form in the app
4. **Review and refine** - Iterate based on what works

---

## Questions for Marty

1. For **HRS Integration (Epic)** - What's the target number of providers/patients for RPM?
2. For **Notable API Migration** - Any performance improvements measured post-migration?
3. For **SDOH Standard** - Expected timeline for full rollout?
4. For **Zoom FHIR Migration** - Any metrics on providers impacted or implementation success?
5. Should we include the **CI Website** as an initiative, or wait until further along?
