## üî¥ REQUIRED ACTIONS (You Must Do These)

### Step 1: Add Database Columns ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Go to:** https://fiyaolxiarzkihlbhtmz.supabase.co

**Navigate to:** SQL Editor ‚Üí New query

**Run this SQL:**

```sql
-- Add all three new columns
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role TEXT;
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ehrs_impacted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE initiatives ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS service_line TEXT;
```

**Verify it worked:**

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'initiatives'
AND column_name IN ('role', 'ehrs_impacted', 'service_line')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

You should see 3 rows returned showing the new columns.

---

### Step 2: Add Completed Initiatives

**In your terminal, run:**

```bash
npx tsx add-completed-initiatives.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
Marty ID: 1c48b25a-8d61-4087-9c19-2317cb0fc950

1. Creating HRS Integration - Remote Patient Monitoring (Cerner - Completed)...
‚úì Created initiative 1: [some-uuid]

2. Creating Zoom/Epic/Cerner Integration FHIR Migration (Completed)...
‚úì Created initiative 2: [some-uuid]

‚úÖ Completed initiatives added successfully!
```

---

### Step 3: Test the Application

**Open:** http://localhost:5175

#### Test 1: View Categorized Initiatives
1. Click **Team** tab
2. Click on **Marty's card**
3. Scroll down to "Major Initiatives & Impact"
4. ‚úÖ Verify you see initiatives grouped by category:
   - Project (should show 4 initiatives)
   - System Initiative (should show 3 initiatives)
   - General Support (should show 1 initiative)
5. ‚úÖ Verify completed initiatives are marked as "Completed" status
6. ‚úÖ Verify color-coded category headers appear

#### Test 2: Verify New Form Fields
1. Click **Add Data** tab
2. ‚úÖ Verify "Role" dropdown appears after "Team Member"
3. ‚úÖ Verify "EHRs Impacted" dropdown appears after "Status"
4. ‚úÖ Verify "Service Line" text input appears after "EHRs Impacted"
5. Try creating a test initiative with all fields filled
6. ‚úÖ Verify it saves successfully

#### Test 3: Verify Marty's Portfolio
1. Go back to **Team** tab ‚Üí Click Marty
2. ‚úÖ Total should still show 19 assignments
3. ‚úÖ Should show "7 initiatives" in the initiatives section
4. ‚úÖ Initiatives should be organized:
   - **Project (4)**
     - HRS Integration - Remote Patient Monitoring (Cerner) - Completed
     - Zoom Integration FHIR Migration - Completed
     - HRS Integration - Remote Patient Monitoring (Epic) - Active
   - **System Initiative (3)**
     - Abridge AI Pilot - Completed
     - Notable Health - RPM to API Migration - Active
     - Clinical Informatics Enterprise Website - Active
   - **General Support (1)**
     - SDOH Standardization - Active

---

## üü° OPTIONAL ACTIONS (Recommended)

### Option 1: Update Existing Initiatives with New Field Data

Run this SQL in Supabase to populate the new fields for existing initiatives:

```sql
-- Update all Marty's initiatives with role, EHR, and service line data
UPDATE initiatives
SET role = 'Primary',
    ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Abridge AI Pilot - Clinical Documentation Efficiency Analysis';

UPDATE initiatives
SET role = 'Primary',
    ehrs_impacted = 'Cerner',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Notable Health - RPM to API Migration';

UPDATE initiatives
SET role = 'Support',
    ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory'
WHERE initiative_name LIKE 'Social Determinants of Health%';

UPDATE initiatives
SET role = 'Support',
    ehrs_impacted = 'All',
    service_line = 'Other'
WHERE initiative_name = 'Clinical Informatics Enterprise Website';

UPDATE initiatives
SET role = 'Primary',
    ehrs_impacted = 'Epic',
    service_line = 'Ambulatory'
WHERE initiative_name = 'HRS Integration - Remote Patient Monitoring'
AND status = 'Active';
```

---

### Option 2: Review and Edit Initiatives via UI

Instead of SQL, you can:
1. Go to **Initiatives** tab
2. Click **Edit** on each initiative
3. Fill in the new fields (Role, EHRs Impacted, Service Line)
4. Click **Update Initiative**

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: SQL Error When Adding Columns

**Solution:** The columns might already exist. Run:

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'initiatives';
```

If you see role, ehrs_impacted, and service_line listed, they're already there!

---

### Problem: Script Fails with "role column doesn't exist"

**Solution:** Make sure you completed Step 1 (adding database columns) BEFORE running the script in Step 2.

---

### Problem: Form Fields Don't Appear

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Verify the dev server is running without errors

---

### Problem: Initiatives Not Categorized

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're looking at the **Team** tab (not Initiatives tab)
2. Click on a team member's card to expand their portfolio
3. Scroll down to the initiatives section
4. Categories only show if there are initiatives of that type

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

1. ‚úÖ Three new columns exist in `initiatives` table
2. ‚úÖ Marty has 7 total initiatives (3 completed, 4 active)
3. ‚úÖ Initiatives are categorized by work type in Team view
4. ‚úÖ Add Data form shows Role, EHRs Impacted, and Service Line fields
5. ‚úÖ You can create new initiatives with all fields
6. ‚úÖ Marty's total assignment count is still 19 (unchanged)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Completion

Once everything is working for Marty:

1. Use the same process for other team members
2. Consider creating bulk import scripts
3. Add filters to Initiatives view for new fields
4. Create reports using EHR and Service Line data
5. Showcase completed work to stakeholders
