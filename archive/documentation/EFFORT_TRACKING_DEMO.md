# Effort Tracking Feature - Demo Guide

## What We Built

A complete **dynamic effort tracking system** that allows SCIs to log their actual time spent on initiatives, visualize workload trends, and manage capacity proactively.

## The Dream → Reality

### Your Vision:
> "I am imagining the ability for an SCI to select an initiative they are working on and indicate potential changes in their time and effort for each assignment... Wouldn't it be nice to even be able to trend that effort over time? To see its ups and downs dynamically?"

### What We Built:

```
✅ Weekly effort logging per initiative
✅ Visual sparklines showing effort trends
✅ Dynamic capacity management
✅ Historical 8-week visualization
✅ Work type breakdown
✅ In-app capacity alerts
✅ Graceful UX for logging and viewing effort
```

## Feature Walkthrough

### 1. Logging Effort (The Entry Point)

**Location**: Any active initiative card

1. Go to "My Effort" view
2. See list of active initiatives
3. Click "Log Effort" on each one
4. Quick entry: 5 initiatives in 2 minutes
5. Review capacity status
6. Done!

### Workflow 2: Sprint Intensity

**During a major go-live:**

2. Sparkline shows upward trend
3. Personal dashboard shows 🟠 Over capacity warning
4. Manager reviews team workload
5. Discusses delegation options
6. After go-live, effort drops back to S (4h)
7. Trend shows decrease ↘
8. Capacity returns to normal 🟢

### Workflow 3: Quarterly Review

## Demo Script (For Showing Leadership)

**Scene 1: The Problem** (30 seconds)
> "Currently, we track that Josh has 47 assignments. But we don't know:
> - How much time is he actually spending on each?
> - Which ones are consuming the most effort?
> - Is he approaching burnout?
> - How did his workload change over time?"

**Scene 2: The Solution** (2 minutes)
> "Now, Josh can log his actual effort each week..."
>
> [Demo clicking "Log Effort" on C5 Titrations]
> [Select "XL - 18 hours"]
> [Add note: "Sprint planning and design work"]
> [Click "Log Effort"]
>
> "And immediately see the trend..."
> [Show sparkline appearing on card]
>
> "His personal dashboard shows the complete picture..."
> [Navigate to "My Effort"]
> [Show capacity at 47 hours - Orange warning]
> [Show breakdown by work type]
>
> "Over 8 weeks, we can see patterns..."
> [Show bar chart trending upward]

**Scene 3: The Impact** (1 minute)
> "This allows us to:
> - Identify overload before burnout occurs
> - Rebalance work proactively
> - Calculate true ROI (effort hours vs. revenue)
> - Plan future resource needs with real data
> - Recognize efficiency gains"

**Scene 4: The Ask** (30 seconds)
> "We've built this on a feature branch. To make it real:
> 1. Run the database migration
> 2. Merge the branch
> 3. Ask team to start logging weekly
> 4. Review data monthly"

## What Makes This Graceful

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Initiative cards don't show effort section until expanded
- Sparkline only appears after first log
- No clutter for initiatives without data

### 2. **Quick Entry**
- Preset buttons for common effort levels
- Default to current week
- "Copy last week" would be trivial to add

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Color-coded capacity status
- Trend indicators (↗↘→)
- Progress bars and charts
- Hover tooltips for details

### 4. **Contextual Help**
- Empty states explain next steps
- Notes field adds rich context
- Week range displayed clearly

### 5. **Forgiving UX**
- Can log past weeks
- Can update existing logs
- Custom hours for precision
- No mandatory fields beyond hours

## Future Enhancements (Easy Wins)

### Next Sprint:
1. **Bulk Entry Interface**: Log all 7 initiatives at once
2. **Copy Last Week**: One-click to duplicate previous week
3. **Team View for Managers**: Aggregated heatmap

### Future:
1. **Effort Templates**: Save common patterns
2. **Auto-reminders**: In-app nudge on Fridays
3. **Export Reports**: Download weekly summaries
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Effort vs. impact scatter plots
