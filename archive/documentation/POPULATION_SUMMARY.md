## Data Quality

### Selection Criteria Applied:

✅ **Included:**
- Projects with defined go-live dates
- System-wide initiatives (multi-market impact)
- Work with measurable outcomes
- Assignments with clinical sponsor/governance oversight
- Significant work effort (M, L, XL size)
- Completed work worth showcasing

❌ **Excluded:**
- Routine governance meeting attendance
- Epic Gold CAT facilitation (unless major deliverable)
- Standard support/consulting work
- Minor optimization requests
- Weekly/monthly recurring meetings

### Data Mapping:

All data was mapped directly from CSV files:

| CSV Column | Initiative Field |
|------------|------------------|
| Assignment | initiative_name |
| Work Type | type |
| Status | status |
| Role | role |
| EHR/s Impacted | ehrs_impacted |
| Service Line | service_line |
| Projected Go-Live Date | end_date |
| Sponsor | clinical_sponsor_name |
| Short Description + Comments/Details | initiative_stories (challenge/approach/outcome) |

## Data Integrity ✅

### Verified:
1. ✅ **total_assignments** counts remain UNCHANGED
2. ✅ All initiatives successfully created (0 errors)
3. ✅ Initiatives include proper categorization by work type
4. ✅ All data sourced from CSV files (no invented information)
5. ✅ Role, EHRs Impacted, and Service Line fields populated where available

### Note on work_type_summary:
The work_type_summary table shows 0 counts for all team members, suggesting it may need to be populated separately. The important verification is that **total_assignments counts have NOT changed**, confirming we followed the critical rule that initiatives are "drill-downs" into existing assignments, not new assignments.

## Files Created

1. **populate-all-scis.ts** - Master script that populated all 69 initiatives in one execution
2. **verify-data-integrity.ts** - Verification script to check data integrity
3. **POPULATION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Next Steps (Optional)

If work_type_summary needs to be populated:
- Review how assignments should be categorized by work type
- Create a script to populate work_type_summary based on CSV data
- Ensure total counts match total_assignments for each team member

## Script Execution

```bash
# To populate all initiatives
npx tsx populate-all-scis.ts

# To verify data integrity
npx tsx verify-data-integrity.ts
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 69 initiatives created with 0 errors (100% success rate)
- ✅ Average of 4.6 initiatives per SCI (range: 3-7)
- ✅ Quality over quantity maintained
- ✅ All data sourced from authoritative CSV files
- ✅ Proper categorization and metadata included
