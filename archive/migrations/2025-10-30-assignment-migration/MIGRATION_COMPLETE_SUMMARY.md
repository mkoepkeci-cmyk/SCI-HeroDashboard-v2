# Assignment to Initiatives Migration - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL** (57/58 items migrated - 98.3% success rate)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated **57 unique assignments** from the legacy `assignments` table to the modern `initiatives` table across **10 System Clinical Informatics (SCI) team members**. This completes the data consolidation phase, establishing `initiatives` as the single source of truth for capacity calculations and workload management.

## Data Integrity Checks

### âœ… Passed Validations:
1. **No duplicates created** - All initiative names unique per SCI
2. **Protected items excluded** - Marty's 4 protected items correctly NOT migrated
3. **Governance items preserved** - GOV-2025-001, GOV-2025-002, GOV-2025-003 intact with full data
4. **Assignment tracking** - All assignments marked with `migration_status`:
   - `NEWLY_MIGRATED_BATCH1/2A/2B/3` - Successfully migrated items
   - `DUPLICATE_ALREADY_IN_INITIATIVES` - Items already in initiatives table
   - `PROTECTED_MANUAL_ENTRY` - Excluded items (Marty's protected records)

### Migration Markers:
All migrated initiatives tagged with `last_updated_by`:
- `MIGRATION_LISA_UNIQUE_ASSIGNMENTS`
- `MIGRATION_BATCH1_LOW_PRIORITY`
- `MIGRATION_BATCH2A_MATT_STUART`
- `MIGRATION_BATCH2B_MARTY_KOEPKE`
- `MIGRATION_BATCH3_JOSH_GREENWOOD`

## Impact on Dashboard

### Capacity Calculations
- **Before**: Some SCIs had assignments in `assignments` table not reflected in capacity cards
- **After**: All active work now in `initiatives` table; capacity cards accurately reflect full workload
- **Refresh Required**: Hard refresh dashboard (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see updated capacity metrics

### Affected Views:
1. **Dashboard â†’ Team View** - TeamCapacityCard now shows accurate initiative counts
2. **Workload â†’ SCI View** (BulkEffortEntry) - All assignments available for effort logging
3. **Workload â†’ Team View** (TeamCapacityView) - Manager capacity cards reflect complete workload
4. **Browse Initiatives** - All migrated items now searchable and filterable

---

## Post-Migration Actions

### âœ… Completed:
1. Name standardization (Marty/Marty Koepke, Lisa/Lisa Townsend)
2. Governance work_effort field fix (Phase 1 & 2 in governanceConversion.ts)
3. Migration of Lisa Townsend's 2 unique items
4. Batch 1 migration (7 SCIs, 15 items)
5. Batch 2A migration (Matt Stuart, 9 items)
6. Batch 2B migration (Marty Koepke, 7-8 items with protections)
7. Batch 3 migration (Josh Greenwood, 26 items)
8. Validation of all migrations

### ðŸ”„ Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Hard refresh dashboard** (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache and load new initiative data
2. **Verify capacity cards** for the 11 migrated SCIs show updated initiative counts
3. **Test effort logging** in My Effort view to ensure all migrated items appear
4. **Review TeamCapacityModal** metrics for accuracy (6-metric productivity view)
5. **Monitor Google Sheets sync** - If sync runs, it may need to be updated or disabled to prevent overwrites

### ðŸ“‹ Future Considerations:
1. **Deprecate assignments table** - Mark as legacy/read-only once sync is disabled
2. **Disable Google Sheets sync** - After users complete data cleanup in Google Sheets
3. **Establish initiatives table as single source of truth** - All new work goes directly to initiatives
4. **Archive migration scripts** - Move SQL scripts to `/archive/migrations/` folder

## Technical Details

### Database Changes:
- **New columns added to assignments table**:
  - `migrated_to_initiatives` (BOOLEAN) - Migration flag
  - `migration_status` (TEXT) - Detailed migration tracking

### Migration Logic:
```sql
-- Duplicate detection (exact match after normalization)
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM initiatives i
  WHERE LOWER(TRIM(i.initiative_name)) = LOWER(TRIM(a.assignment_name))
    AND i.team_member_id = a.team_member_id
    AND i.status != 'Deleted'
)
```

### Protected Item Exclusion (Marty Koepke):
```sql
-- Exclude governance items (have governance_request_id)
AND governance_request_id IS NULL

-- Exclude manual entries by name
AND a.assignment_name NOT ILIKE '%Medicare Annual Wellness%'
AND a.assignment_name NOT ILIKE '%Depression Screening%'
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Name standardization critical** - "Marty" vs "Marty Koepke" caused false positives in unique counts
2. **Batch approach successful** - Migrating in phases (low/medium/high priority) reduced risk
3. **Protected item handling** - Explicit exclusion logic prevented accidental migration of governance/manual items
4. **Validation essential** - Multiple validation queries caught issues before they affected production
5. **Migration markers helpful** - `last_updated_by` field enables easy identification and rollback of migrated items
